# 🌟 C# Operators Playground 🌟

Welcome to a vibrant little sandbox where I play with C# operators and explore the magic behind basic programming logic!  
Whether you're just starting out or need a refresher, this is a fun stop on your learning journey. 🧠💡

## 🎯 About This Project

This mini-project is a **hands-on exercise** I created while learning the core building blocks of C#. It covers:

🔹 Arithmetic operators (➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗)  
🔹 Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, etc.)  
🔹 Logical operators (&&, ||, !)  

I wanted to understand how values interact through operators in different scenarios—and this little console app does just that.

## 💻 How to Use

1. Clone this repo  
2. Open it in **Visual Studio**, **Rider**, or your favorite C# IDE  
3. Hit `Run` and explore how operators behave in real time  

> 📦 You can also tweak the values and experiment—this playground is yours!

## ✨ Why It Matters

Understanding operators is the foundation of writing logic. This project is intentionally kept **simple and clean** to focus on core concepts without distractions.

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

✅ Practice syntax  
✅ Observe how different operators behave  
✅ Build confidence with C# basics

## 🚀 What's Next?

I'll be adding more beginner-friendly projects here soon—loops, conditionals, arrays, and beyond!
